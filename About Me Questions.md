# About Me!

#### Tell us about a time you messed up and what you learned from it. (200 word limit)

    Over the past year I have been given increasing amounts of responsibility in my role, to the point where 
    I have been in charge of interview and hiring, staff training and discipline as well as running a social 
    media account. These additional responsibilities have come with no training or handover process, leaving 
    me to work things out as I go along. Taking on these extra tasks was a way of challenging myself in a role 
    where I was feeling unfulfilled. However, my thirst for challenge went too far, too quickly, leaving me overwhelmed 
    and unable to complete tasks to the high standard that I expect from myself. I made mistakes with hiring a candidate
    who did not have enough technical skiing experience, resulting in a rehire. It was only after bringing my lack of training 
    and amount of responsibilities to the attention of higher level managers, that I received the support I was looking for. 
    
    My mistake is not asking for help sooner. Fear and a sense of embarrassment prevented me from seeking help, yet 
    I was able to be a better and happier employee once overcoming this hurdle. Not to mention, management being
    both understanding and compassionate.

#### If you were to open a Shopify store, what would you sell and why (or tell us about your store if you have one!) (200 word limit)

    Having run a Depop shop (depop.com/liamk3nny) throughout university, selling limited sneakers and clothing, I 
    would want to incorporate these items into a Shopify store. With resale prices of sneakers regularly hitting 
    3/400% above their retail value, there is a huge market for both new and used, limited edition sneakers and 
    clothing. With such a deep routed connection between streetwear and skateboarding, I would want to include a 
    skate portion of my shop. Here, I would source and sell collectable and limited runs of skateboard decks and 
    hardware. Sneakers and clothing would provide me with a steady income throughout the year, with skate sales 
    being focused on the summer months. Having a hugely in-depth knowledge of snowboards, I would supplement winter 
    sales with sales of limited decks, boots, bindings and outerwear. With much of my buying and selling of streetwear
    and snowboards being international, Shopify's ability to automatically calculate taxes and shipping rates would
    be a real asset to my business. 
    
    My store would sell both new and pre owned, limited and collectable snow, skate and streetwear items at a premium.
    We would ensure both quality and authentisity of items difficult to source and with limited availability.

#### Any last thoughts? (ie. proud accomplishments, cool ideas, a joke, etc.) (200 word limit)

    Having taken two years to pursue my life-long passion of snowboarding and living in the mountains, I have come to 
    realise the things which I value the most. Firstly, challenge. I need to feel both challenged and excited by the
    work that I do. I need room for growth and personal development as well as drive to keep me motivated. Secondly,
    I need flexibility to pursue my own goals. Working remotely is a dream of mine I hope to achieve as soon as possible.
    I am a more engaging, motivated and driven person being given a work-life balance which allows me to follow my
    passion for sport and adventure. Finally, a place in this world. Younger generations are facing more competition
    for jobs than ever, leading to many feeling lost and without purpose. Spending my working day sharing my
    experiences, collaborating with others and helping those around me gives me purpose and is essential for my
    long term mental wellbeing. One day, I plan to use my skills in data science and technology to help analyse 
    trends related to global warming, natural disasters and other climate related research in order to better the lives 
    of generations to come.
